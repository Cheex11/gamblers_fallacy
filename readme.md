This script runs through a large set of flips.

If three consecutive flips occur, the program will bet $500 that the next flip will NOT be the same.  Starting with only $500, the program will run until out of money or until a set number of flips have occured (default is 500,000).  At the end, the program will print how many trials occured and the highest amount of cash accumulated during the trials.
