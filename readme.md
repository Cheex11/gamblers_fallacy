This script runs through a large set of flips.

v1
If three consecutive flips occur, the program will bet $500 that the next flip will be different.  Starting with only $500, the program will run until out of money or until a set number of flips have occured (default is 500,000).  At the end, the program will print how many trials occured and the highest amount of cash accumulated during the trials.

I've only run it about ten times since making it but the max I got was $49,300 after 500,000 trials.  The most cash during that run was $50,900.  This run yielded ten times the starting cash.


v2
I increased the starting amount to $50,000 so the program can reliably run longer ($5,000 was not a large enough buffer against zero).  I've again run it about 10 times and rarely get anywhere close to the starting $50,000 cash.
